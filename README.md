## Text Correction Script
This Python script corrects the spelling of words in a given .docx file using the TextBlob library. It also adds punctuation marks to sentences that don't end with one, using the NLTK tokenize library.

## Prerequisites
Before using this script, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

docx
textblob
nltk
You can install them using pip:

'''
pip install python-docx
pip install textblob
pip install nltk'''

## How to Use
Place the script in the same directory as the .docx file you want to correct.
Replace the file name in line 6 with the name of your file.
Run the script.
The corrected .docx file will be saved as "output.docx" in the same directory as the original file.

Note: This script skips autocorrection for nouns and proper nouns to prevent unnecessary corrections that may result in errors.
